# Phishing Attack Simulation with Gophish and Poste.io

## Objective

This project showcases the setup and execution of a **controlled phishing simulation lab** using **Gophish** and **Poste.io**. The goal is to safely explore how phishing attacks work and strengthen cybersecurity skills in a hands-on environment.

**Key Objectives:**
- Conduct realistic phishing campaigns in a controlled lab setting  
- Understand the functionality and capabilities of phishing tools  
- Learn how phishing attacks are implemented in real-world scenarios  
- Enhance cybersecurity and technical skillsets through practical experience
